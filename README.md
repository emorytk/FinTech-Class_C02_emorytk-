# Qualifying Loan Feature added to Loan Application

This project involves adding a feature to the loan application, where the software will prompt users to save the qualifying loans searched for in a new CSV file. The original application uses data from a 'daily_rate_sheet" and this feature will use that same data, only it will save the search in a separate file.

## Installation Guide

First, make sure that you are using python 3.7 if you are working in Windows 10 or 11, as python will automatically default to a more recent version of python if you are. This will prevent python from not recognizing that both have been installed.

Next, install fire and questionary from GitHub.
